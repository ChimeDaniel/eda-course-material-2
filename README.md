# Data Visualization with Matplotlib: Tutorial

This project contains a data visualization tutorial I created for a company outreach program using Jupyter Notebook with Colab. The tutorial focuses on data visualization techniques using the Matplotlib library in Python.

## Description
This tutorial covers various aspects of data visualization using Matplotlib, including:
- Basic plots (line plots, scatter plots, bar plots)
- Customizing plots (labels, titles, colors, styles)
- Subplots and layouts
- Advanced plots (histograms, box plots, pie charts)

The main file for the tutorial is `ada_data_visualization_with_matplotlib_module_3.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook file containing the tutorial content and code examples.

## File
- `ada_data_visualization_with_matplotlib_module_3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the data visualization tutorial.

## Usage
To run the tutorial:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Open the notebook file `ada_data_visualization_with_matplotlib_module_3.ipynb` in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about data visualization with Matplotlib and execute the code examples.

## Dependencies
This tutorial requires the following Python libraries:
- Matplotlib

Ensure that you have these libraries installed before running the code.
